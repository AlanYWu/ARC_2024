This is done with all the train samples until\nwe give the test input and use the response of the model as the prediction.\nIn addition I also use data augmentations (flips and rotations) to make up to two predictions for each task.\nThe data augmentation is also useful because sometimes the prediction of the model is invalid, so we have to make multiple predictions to have 2 valid responses.\n\n| train | evaluation | test |\n|-------|------------|------|\n| 6.40% | 2.50%      | 0%   |\n\nThis approach is able to solve some of the train and evaluation task, but it does not solve any of the test tasks.\n\n### Few-shot results\n\nUsing samples from the evaluation dataset I have evaluated the effect of using few-shot prompting. In this case\nI have changed the prompt style: the user shows input-output pairs to the assistant and then requests the assistant\nto predict the output given some input.\n\n| n shots | accuracy | correct_pixels | correct_size | unanswered |\n|---------|----------|----------------|--------------|------------|\n| 0       | 5.80%    | 55.10%         | 73.50%       | 17.40%     |\n| 1       | 4.50%    | 44.80%         | 61.00%       | 23.60%     |\n| 2       | 4.80%    | 37.70%         | 54.40%       | 29.80%     |\n| 4       | 2.50%    | 22.40%         | 33.10%       | 33.10%     |\n| 8       | 2.30%    | 23.10%         | 35.50%       | 36.80%     |\n\nThe results show that Phi-3 does not benefit from few-shot prompting with ARC tasks. As we give more\nexamples the results get worse.\n\n### Add reasoning\n\nI have manually described with text the transformation of some of the evaluation tasks. Then repeat\nthe few-shot experiment but adding the reasoning before creating the grid.\n\n| uses reasoning | accuracy | correct_pixels | correct_size | unanswered |\n|----------------|----------|----------------|--------------|------------|\n| No             | 2.50%    | 22.40%         | 33.10%       | 33.10%     |\n| Yes            | 1%       | 19%            | 30.70%       | 42.50%     |\n\nThe model does not understand the puzzles. The examples and reasoning are not useful\n\n### Different models, zero-shot\n\nSince the best results were obtained for the 0-shot setup, I could try using different models.\nI can make submissions without using compute time, so I could see if some of the models is able\nto solve some task from the test set.\n\n| model      | test |\n|------------|------|\n| Phi-3      | 0    |\n| Mistral 7b | 0    |\n| Llama 3 8b | 1    |\n| Llama 3.1 8b | 0    |\n\nLlama 3 is able to solve one of the tasks from the test set. To better compare the models I should\nevaluate them on the public data, but I don't have Kaggle compute available.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFew-shot or zero-shot inference with current LLMs is not the way to solve the ARC challenge.\nThe performance is very poor.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## References","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Notebooks","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- https://www.kaggle.com/code/ironbar/2xvllm-with-code-interpreter\n- https://www.kaggle.com/code/ironbar/autobots-roll-out/notebook","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Models","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct\n- https://huggingface.co/blog/kv-cache-quantization\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1e0kkgk/hardware_requirements_for_phi3_mini_and_phi3/\n- https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fmicrosoft-phi-3-3-8b-with-128k-context-released-on-hf-v0-h2xzg8vaigwc1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D1734%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dec27de7bd97a90a4c44ff95c561ce8008ce7aed3\n- https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> The Phi-3-Mini-128K-Instruct is a 3.8 billion-parameter, lightweight, state-of-the-art open model trained using the Phi-3 datasets.

The model could fail to generate a prediction, or the parsing can fail... Thus we need a method that is robust to fails.\n\nOne way to solve this would be to use data augmentation. By applying rotations and flips we could generate up to 8 variations of each task. So we could try with different data augmentations until we have 2 predictions for each task. Another alternative would be to make inference with the 8 variations and use majority voting.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def solve_task(task_id, task, prompt_creator, sampling_params):\n    data_augmentation_params = product([False, True], [0, 1, 2, 3])\n    solution = {task_id:[{\"attempt_1\": [], \"attempt_2\": []} for _ in task['test']]}\n    texts = dict(prompts=[], responses=[], exceptions=[])\n    for flip, n_rot90 in islice(data_augmentation_params, cfg.max_predictions_per_task):\n        data_augmentation = DataAugmentation(flip, n_rot90)\n        augmented_task = data_augmentation.augment_task(task)\n        prompts = prompt_creator.create_task_prompts(augmented_task)\n        outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)\n        responses = [output.outputs[0].text for output in outputs]\n        for idx, response in enumerate(responses):\n            try:\n                augmented_grid = prompt_creator.parse_response(response)\n                grid = data_augmentation.revert_augmentation(augmented_grid)\n                if not solution[task_id][idx][\"attempt_1\"]:\n                    solution[task_id][idx][\"attempt_1\"] = grid\n                elif solution[task_id][idx][\"attempt_1\"] != grid and not solution[task_id][idx][\"attempt_2\"]:\n                    solution[task_id][idx][\"attempt_2\"] = grid\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f'Exception when parsing response from {task_id}: {e}')\n                texts['exceptions'].append(str(e))\n        texts['prompts'].append(prompts)\n        texts['responses'].append(responses)\n        if is_solution_done(solution):\n            break\n    return solution, {task_id:texts}\n\ndef is_solution_done(solution):\n    for task_id, predictions in solution.items():\n        for prediction in predictions:\n            for grid in prediction.values():\n                if not grid:\n                    return False\n    return True","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.538327Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.539439Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.568306Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.539343Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.566328Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":34},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def inference(data, prompt_creator, sampling_params):\n    solutions, texts = dict(), dict()\n    for task_id, task in tqdm(data.items(), total=len(data)):\n        task_solution, task_texts = solve_task(task_id, task, prompt_creator, sampling_params)\n        solutions.update(task_solution)\n        texts.update(task_texts)\n    return solutions, texts","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.573170Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.575025Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.588908Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.574955Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.586538Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":35},{"cell_type":"code","source":"with open(cfg.dataset_path) as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\nif cfg.n_tasks is not None:\n    data = dict(islice(data.items(), cfg.n_tasks))\nprint(f'There are {len(data)} tasks to solve.')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.592490Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.593550Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.621169Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.593479Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.620300Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"There are 100 tasks to solve.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":36},{"cell_type":"code","source":"if not is_dry_run:\n    #prompt_creator = FewShotPromptCreator(GridCodeBlockEncoder(MinimalGridEncoder()))\n    #prompt_creator = SimplePromptCreator(GridCodeBlockEncoder(MinimalGridEncoder()))\n    prompt_creator = SimplePromptCreator(GridCodeBlockEncoder(GridWithSeparationEncoder('|')))\n    print_sample_prompt(data, prompt_creator)\n    plot_input_token_length_distribution(data, prompt_creator)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.622364Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.622642Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-05T22:36:29.613080Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-05T22:36:28.622619Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-05T22:36:29.612164Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[1m\u001b[30m<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\u001b[0m\n\u001b[30m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[30mYou are a helpful AI assistant.
